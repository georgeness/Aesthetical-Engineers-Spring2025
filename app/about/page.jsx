      <p className="mb-4">
        At this point, there is no sole reason why I make art. I know - I do it for the enjoyment of doing it. However, for many years, one of my quests has been to enhance my own awareness of who I am as a human being. My experience is that I have used creating art to heighten this awareness.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        I was born in Brooklyn, New York. I recognized the passion I had for art and the making of it at a very young age. Somehow, I knew that I was going to study art and identify myself as a visual artist.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Four years after graduating from the State University of New York Maritime College and going to sea as a Deck Officer on American cargo ships, I left New York and drove to Tempe, Arizona to study art at Arizona State University.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        I have two undergraduate degrees: a BFA in Painting and Drawing from Arizona State and a BS in Meteorology and Oceanography from SUNY Maritime College.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        I live in Florida, and have a studio in West Palm Beach not far from the ocean.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        My recent work consists of large colorful non-objective pieces, which contain a large amount of underpainting. I use simple geometric forms – mostly squares, rectangles and at times triangles in their creation.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        While painting, I mostly concern myself with color balance – and how I move the viewer’s eye on the canvas. Color value is another element that I concern myself with as I paint.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        My paintings have much to do with the manipulation of space, color and paint. To a great extent, my non-objective work is an expression of my present awareness of the power of being present.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        My work is purposely void of representationalism, story or poetry. There is the space, the color and the paint.
